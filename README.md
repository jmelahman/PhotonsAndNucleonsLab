# PhotonsAndNucleonsLab
Lab reports from a photon and nucleons lab I made while at Ohio University.
The lab adviser was Dr. Paul King of Ohio University.
The majority of the experiments were performed at the Edwards Accelerator at Ohio University in Athens, OH.
Each lab has three associated files: the final report in PDF format, the LaTeX file to make the PDF file, and the corresponding bibliography file.
